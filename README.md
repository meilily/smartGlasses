# smartGlasses
Simple voice operated Smart glasses using Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 and XIAO ESP32S3

# Introduction
  Smart glasses are a new emerging technology where glasses are fitted with embedded systems to provide information to the user without the need to constantly pull out ones phone. The glasses work by having a small screen that then has its image magnified and reflected through a wave guide in such way that the display is magnified and allowed to be in focus in front of the users eye. The project will be used to learn more about IOT as wifi and possible Bluetooth will be involved, in addition to possible ML/AI as the glasses will be trained to respond to voice commands.

Original driver code by EastRising Technology contains modifications for custom characters.
